# Memory Card

The application includes a scoreboard, which counts the current score, and a “Best Score”, which shows the highest score you’ve achieved thus far. There is a function that displays the cards in a random order anytime a user clicks one. That function is invoked when the component mounts.
There are handful of cards that display images and informational text. These images and texts are fetched from an external API. We use Giphy API for this. Certain level of styiling is applied to make the app look nice and sleek.
